# Introduction
The deployment of covid-19 vaccines in India was done in a sudden burst and thus the tracking became very complicated. Due to multiple input and output commands on the server, it resulted in several slow running issues and crashes. The Aadhar details were used to allot the vaccines and hence it operated on a central server. To avoid the use of central server for all commmands, a local server will be loaded with the vaccine-registered data. Local verification and completion of vaccination data will be processed locally and will be loaded back to the main server by the end of day.

Each vaccine centre will operate locally to register and allot vaccines. The basic registration can be done online and schedules are set as desired by the patient. Assuming a vaccination centre can vaccinate around 100 people in a day. The data handling for online basic registration will be mostly done in the day time and the data acquired by the local centres of vaccinated people can be handled in the night.

The local server must store the data of around 100 people where the allocated online registration data will be loaded onto the local server of that local centre. Verification of the data is done based on the details provided by the patient. Once completed, the data of the vaccinated will be sent back for future use and reference.

### Advantages
Smoother data handling.
Pre data readily available for verification.
Flexibility to add new registrations limited with server alloted memory.
### Disadvantages
Cannot add large number of new registrations due to local server limitations.
Encryption is not enabled to protect the data.
OTP verification is not activated for new registrations.

### Who:
The project can be used almost by all the particular organization people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.

### What:
Adding, deleting, viewing and searching of books can be done by this system without manual efforts of the librarian.

### When:
The project can be used when the book needs to be added,issued or removed

### Where:
The Library management system is nowadays essential for schools, colleges, private libraries, and other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of books issuing and returning for renewal.

### How:
System design is a solution for how to approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
